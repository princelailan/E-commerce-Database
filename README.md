# E-commerce Database Design

Hi there! I'm **Joseph Onyango**, and this project is part of my journey through the Power Learn Project – Cohort VII (February 2025).

This database design lays the foundation for a fully functional and scalable e-commerce platform. It handles everything from product management to dynamic attributes like size, color, material, and stock — all structured with efficiency and future expansion in mind.

## Why This Project?

In today's digital world, online shopping platforms are everywhere. Building a database that can support such a system requires careful planning, normalization, and smart relationships. This project helped me think like a systems architect, designing each table to solve real-world e-commerce challenges.

## What’s Inside

- **`ecommerce.sql`** — A full SQL script to create the database schema.
- **`erd-image.png`** — A visual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to help you see how everything connects.

## Features

- Organized product catalog with categories and brands
- Product variations by color and size
- Flexible stock tracking and pricing
- Dynamic attributes (like weight, material, or custom fields)
- Easy-to-understand structure for scaling and maintenance

## Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL** — SQL syntax compatible with most database servers
- **Draw.io / dbdiagram.io** — Used to build the ERD

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `ecommerce.sql` in your SQL tool (like MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin).
3. Run the script to create all tables.
4. Refer to `erd-image.png` to understand the data model.
