This project was created by **Joseph Onyango** as part of the Power Learn Project — Cohort VII (February 2025).

## Files Included

- `ecommerce.sql`: SQL script for creating all tables and constraints
- `erd-image.png`: ERD diagram image
- `erd-mermaid.md`: ERD in Mermaid.js format for GitHub or Live Editor rendering

## Technologies Used

- MySQL / MariaDB
